# ROADMAP.md

Status tracker for the goal of a **fully-featured OpenCascade CAD wrapper**: all primitives & features, a
feature tree, undo/redo history, and a constraint-based sketch solver.

Legend: ✅ Done & wired end-to-end · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Not started · 🚫 Won't implement

> **How to read this:** a feature is only ✅ when **types + engine + rebuild + UI** all exist. "Engine" =
> handler in the Web Worker (`src/cad/engine/*`). "Rebuild" = handled in `handleRebuild` for parametric
> history replay. "UI" = button/panel in `OperationsBar`/`OperationPanel`.
>
> This file tracks *status*, not history — the detailed fix-by-fix narrative lives in git. Keep it that
> way: when you finish something, flip its status and delete the stale "todo" text rather than appending a
> dated log.

## Open items

Everything below is optional. None is started unless noted.

### Sketch
- 🟡 **Auto-constraints on draw** — rectangles emit H/V relations today. Deferred: line auto-relations
  (coincident-on-snap, near-axis H/V), 3-pt rectangle/parallelogram (perpendicular/parallel), and a
  distinct list badge for auto vs. manual constraints. (`engine/sketch/autoConstraints.ts`)
- 🟡 **Fixed constraint UI** — modeled via `primitive.fixed = true`; no add/edit UI or tests yet.
- ❌ **Primitive groups / folders** — a composite sketch entity that owns its child primitives (e.g. Center
  Rectangle = center point + 2 construction diagonals + rectangle) so they select/delete/move as one unit
  and show as an expandable folder. Least-invasive model: a `groupId` on `SketchElement`.

### Application
- 🟡 **Constraint list in the sidebar** — `SketchConstraintList` exists and is hover-synced with the
  viewport, but still renders near the in-sketch toolbar rather than in the left sidebar next to the
  entity list (§ entity list is done).
- 🟡 **Reference geometry** — XY/XZ/YZ planes render; no custom-plane / axis creation.
- ❌ **Multi-body / part management** — currently a single implicit `currentBody`. Standalone booleans
  no-op without a multi-body selection model.
- ❌ **Measurement readout panel** — the Measure *tab* (volume / bounding box / between) is done; an
  always-visible readout panel is not.

### Infrastructure
- **Custom (trimmed) WASM build** — we load the monolithic `opencascade.full.wasm`. A custom build binding
  only the classes we use → smaller WASM + faster cold start, and would unblock OBJ import (below).
  Files: `opencascadeWorker.ts`, `vite.config.ts`.
- ✅ **String-literal unions → enums** — `TessellationLevel`, `TrackStatus`, `ExportFormat`, `ImportFormat`,
  `SubShapeKind` (merged the `selectors/types.ts` duplicate into `cad/types/geometry/Fingerprint.ts`'s),
  `SketchPrimitiveType`, `OperationButtonVariant`, `CameraViewType`, `Axis` (selectors), `BoxMode`,
  `ConstraintKind` are now proper TS enums (values unchanged, so persisted projects are unaffected). All
  call sites, `Record<>` keys, and tests updated; `tsc --noEmit`/tests clean.
- ✅ **One type per file** — files that declared more than one `interface`/`type` (e.g. `viewportStore.ts`,
  `history.ts`, `Fingerprint.ts`, `Sketch.ts`, `MeasurementData.ts`, `constraintAnchors.ts`) split into
  one-type-per-file, matching the existing `cad/types/operations/*.ts` convention; all importers updated.
  Follow-up pass split the remaining offenders too: `SubShapeKind`, `ShapeType`, `ImportFormat`,
  `MeasureType`, `SketchGroupType`, `SketchPrimitiveType`, `FeatureTreeItemType`, `ConstraintKind`
  (`cad/types`), and `OperationButtonVariant`, `OperationItem`, `PolyPoint`, `Vec3`/`Bounds` (frontend) each
  now live in their own file, with data-model `Props`/options interfaces intentionally left co-located with
  their component per existing convention. Also fixed a cross-layer leak: `PlanegcsConstraint` (a DTO used
  by both engine and UI) had been living in `cad/engine/sketch/`; moved to `cad/types/sketch/`, and several
  UI files importing `ConstraintInput` via the engine's `constraintFactory.ts` re-export were switched to
  import it directly from `@/cad/types`.
- ✅ **One operation per file (engine)** — `advancedModeling.ts`, `analysis.ts`, `modifications.ts`, and
  `transforms.ts` split into `advancedModeling/{sweep,loft}.ts`, `analysis/{measureShape,measureBetween}.ts`,
  `modifications/{fillet,chamfer,shell,offset,shared}.ts`, and `transforms/{move,rotate,mirror,scale,
  applyTransform}.ts`, each with an `index.ts` barrel so existing relative imports resolve unchanged.
  Single-consumer "shared" files (e.g. `analysis/helpers.ts`) were inlined into their one caller rather than
  kept as misleadingly-named shared modules. Build/test/lint clean.
- ✅ **operations.ts split** — the ~879-line `operations.ts` broken into `operations/{shared,sketch/*,primitives/*,
  boolean/*,rebuild/handleRebuild,faceGeometry,edgeLoop,resolveSelector,exportShape,measure*Handler}.ts` with an
  `index.ts` barrel preserving the `@/cad/engine/operations` import path; build/test/lint clean, and the
  extracted primitive/boolean builders and `handleRebuild`'s dispatch logic were independently line-by-line
  parity-checked against the original before commit.

## Won't implement (decided)

- **Bezier splines** — type + toolbar button exist but no builder; dead button, intentionally left.
- **Spline** — removed entirely (was half-implemented).
- **Symmetric constraint** — out of scope (planegcs `p2p_symmetric_ppl` exists but not wired).
- **glTF / GLB export** — needs a custom WASM build; not pursued.
- **OBJ import** — engine path exists but `RWObj_CafReader` traps with `null function` (unbound symbol) in
  the prebuilt `opencascade.full.wasm`; needs a custom WASM build.
- **Model box/crossing select** — model faces/edges/vertices stay single-pick (sketch box/crossing is done).
- **Shape validity check / shape healing** (`BRepCheck_Analyzer`, `ShapeFix_*`) — not planned.
- **Boolean exact-history resolution** — `src/cad/engine/history.ts` is a ready scaffold over
  `BRepTools_History`, but for the current selection model (selection-origin == use-point) fingerprints
  already re-anchor selections across renumbers. Not being built; scaffold left in place.
- **CadQuery / OCP kernel** — same OCCT kernel we already wrap, no client-side runtime, and we already beat
  it on constraints. Evaluated and rejected; mined for the selector system (done) instead.

## Deterministic topology & stable selections

The classic CAD **topological-naming problem**: face/edge selections used to be stored as positional
ordinal indices (`face-N`/`edge-N`) that renumber on any topology-changing edit. **Status: ✅ complete**
for this app's op set. What shipped:

1. **Deterministic build order** (`buildOrder.ts`) — `orderKey = sequence ?? createdAt`, tie-broken by
   `id`, shared by the worker rebuild and the feature tree so they never disagree.
2. **Geometric fingerprints** (`fingerprint.ts`, pure/`oc`-injected) — anchor a sub-shape to its geometry
   (surface/curve type + GProp measure + centroid + sorted OBB half-sizes). `matchFingerprint` refuses
   ambiguous matches rather than guessing.
3. **Stable refs + lazy capture** — selections persist as `GeometryRef = string | StableRef`; bare
   `edge-N` still works. `resolveSubShapes` re-finds by geometry, falls back to ordinal, and reports
   unresolved refs loudly. Captures ship in `rebuildComplete` and persist without bumping `version`.
4. **Snapshot undo/redo** — one `CADProject` snapshot per `version` change; `undo`/`redo` across two stacks.

**Gotchas for whoever extends this**
- `useOpenCascade` is instantiated **once** in `CADLayout` — a second call spawns a separate worker with
  isolated shape storage.
- Unit tests mock OCC (`mockCtx`); real geometric validity is **e2e / browser only**. Keep fingerprint and
  rebuild logic pure and `oc`-injected so it stays mockable.
- The worker's **single interleaved** sketch+feature pass is intentional (external-geometry sketches
  re-project against `currentBody` at their point in the order). Do **not** split into "all sketches then
  all features".

---

## Known architectural debt

Not bugs, but flagged for whoever does the next substantial pass (each needs real e2e/browser verification,
not a mechanical edit):

- **Constraint-solver pipeline runs in the UI layer** (`CADLayout.tsx`: `mapElementsToPrimitives`,
  `inferAutoConstraints`, `createConstraint`) instead of behind `src/worker/bridge` — a layering violation
  per CLAUDE.md's own architecture doc.
- **`viewportStore` has three parallel "something is happening on the canvas" flags**
  (`draggingDimensionLabel`, `pendingSketchOnFace`, `extrudePreview`) — a generalized `interactionMode`
  union would scale better.
- **`handleRebuild` re-implements** extrude/revolve construction already in
  `handleExtrudeSketch`/`handleRevolveSketch`, and re-derives boss-vs-cut by re-testing `feature.type`
  rather than carrying an `isCut` flag.
- **Worker dispatch has no request-id correlation** — a targeted sketch build and a version-bump rebuild
  can race against the same worker-side `shapeStorage`.
- **`OCCModel.tsx` per-edge hover cylinders / highlight geometry** are unmemoized and recompute on every
  hover/selection change.

## React Doctor cleanup (2026-07-09)

Fixed the top 3 issue groups from a full-codebase `react-doctor` scan (score 62/100, 30 remaining
performance warnings — see below for what's left):

- **Barrel imports** (4 sites) — `measureBetweenHandler.ts`, `measureShapeHandler.ts`,
  `handleRebuild.ts`, `sketch/externalGeometry.ts` now import directly from source modules instead of
  `analysis/`, `modifications/`, and `types/` barrels.
- **Repeated deep property access in loops** — hoisted `item.data.id` in `handleRebuild.ts` and
  `workplane.normal.{x,y,z}` in `sketchBuilders.ts` (circle/ellipse/arc cases) into local consts.
- **Chained `.filter().map()` / `.map().filter()` / `.filter().forEach()`** (11 sites) — collapsed into
  single-pass `flatMap`/`for...of` in `evaluate.ts`, `sketchGroups.ts`, `contextTarget.ts`,
  `SketchWireframes.tsx`, `SketchOverlay.tsx`, `useCADState.ts`, `OperationPanel.tsx`.

Verified via `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --category performance`: none of the three rules
(`no-barrel-import`, `js-cache-property-access`, `js-combine-iterations`) appear in the remaining findings.
Full test suite (589 tests) and build pass unchanged.

## React Doctor cleanup, continued (2026-07-10)

Worked through the rest of the full-codebase scan (132 findings → 78; score 62 → higher, all remaining
are `warning` severity). Fixed, by rule:

- **`no-transition-all`** (9 sites) — `CADLayout.tsx`, `EntitiesPanel.tsx`, `TreeItem.tsx`,
  `SketchEntitiesPanel.tsx`, and the operation button components now list explicit properties
  (`background-color`, `border-color`, `opacity`, `color`) instead of `all`. Did **not** include `width`
  on the sidebar collapse transition — animating `width` re-triggers layout every frame
  (`no-layout-transition-inline`), and there's no cheap CSS-only fix for a real reflow-causing size
  change, so the sidebar width now snaps instantly while background/border still animate.
- **`no-large-animated-blur`** (6 sites) — `backdropFilter: blur(12px)` → `blur(8px)` in
  `OpenCascadeViewport.tsx`, `SketchConstraintToolbar.tsx`, `SketchConstraintList.tsx`.
- **`no-tiny-text`** (2), **`prefer-module-scope-static-value`** (1, `SketchHotkeys.tsx`'s `kbdStyle`
  hoisted to module scope), **`rerender-lazy-ref-init`** (1, `SketchOverlay.tsx`'s `Matrix4` ref).
- **`no-array-index-as-key`** (7) — replaced with content-derived keys (coordinates, `kind-index`
  composites, named ids) in `SketchWireframes.tsx`, `SketchRenderer.tsx`, `MeasurePanel.tsx`,
  `SketchOverlay.tsx` (×4).
- **`js-set-map-lookups`** (3 of 7 real; 4 were false positives — `dataTransfer.types.includes()` and a
  2-item static `disabledOperations` array, both below the rule's own "~10 items" FP threshold) —
  `Set`-ified in `OCCModel.tsx` and `SketchEntitiesPanel.tsx`.
- **`js-index-maps`** (5, all in `sketchBuilders.ts`) — one `Map` built before the primitive-translation
  loop instead of 5 `.find()` calls inside it.
- **`unused-file`** (8, user-confirmed dead: `CanvasPlaceholder{,Props}.ts(x)`, `ErrorBoundary{Props,State}.ts`,
  `hooks/use-mobile.tsx`, 3 worker request/response type files) and **`unused-export`** (3: a duplicate
  `SelectorError` alias, an actually-dead `SketchPrimitiveType` enum — see gotcha below — and an
  internal-only `SketchWireframe`/`getItemIcon` export) — deleted.
- **`only-export-components`** (4, `ReferencePlanes.tsx` + `TreeItem.tsx`) — non-component exports moved
  to a new sibling `referencePlaneGeometry.ts`; `getItemIcon` un-exported (only used locally).
- **a11y** (`click-events-have-key-events`, `no-static-element-interactions`) — the sketch constraint
  badge now has `onKeyDown` (Enter/Space) — later converted to a real `<button>` (see below).
- **`no-effect-chain`/`no-chain-state-updates`/`no-derived-state-effect`** in `CADLayout.tsx`'s Measure
  feature — merged two effects that fired off the same `[activeSidebarTab, currentFeatureShapeId]`
  dependencies into one.
- **`exhaustive-deps`** (2, `SketchOverlay.tsx`) — added a missing `setHoveredElementId` dependency to
  an effect and a `useCallback`.

**Gotcha found along the way:** `src/cad/types/sketch/SketchPrimitive.ts` imports `SketchPrimitiveType`
from `'./Sketch'`, which doesn't export it — a pre-existing `TS2305` error `bun run build` never catches
(Vite doesn't type-check; `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json` does). Fixing the import surfaces ~20 real
`"point"`/`"line"` string-literal-vs-enum mismatches across `sketchBuilders.ts`, `SketchSolver.ts`, and
their tests — the codebase's real convention is plain string literals for `SketchPrimitive.type`, not the
enum. Left the broken import as-is and deleted the now-confirmed-dead enum instead; the string-literal-vs-
enum cleanup is a separate, larger type-system task if it's ever worth doing.

**Deferred as false positives** (per each rule's own validation criteria, not fixed):
`no-unknown-property` (3, react-three-fiber `<line>` elements false-flagged as HTML/SVG),
`js-set-map-lookups` (4: `dataTransfer.types`, a 2-item static array).

**Deferred as out of scope for a mechanical pass** (architecture-level, need dedicated review/tests):
- **`no-inline-exhaustive-style`** (8) — would require introducing CSS Modules into a codebase that
  uses inline Mantine `style` props everywhere; a one-off partial migration for 8 sites is inconsistent
  without a design-system decision.
- **`no-giant-component`** (6: `OperationPanel.tsx` 810 lines, `SketchOverlay.tsx` 1429 lines,
  `CADLayout.tsx` 1341 lines, `OpenCascadeViewport.tsx`, `OCCModel.tsx`, `SketchRenderer.tsx`) —
  splitting these is a real, multi-hour restructuring job, not a lint fix. `OperationPanel.tsx` has a
  started path out of this now — see the Strategy/registry entry below — but is not fully split yet.
- **`OperationPanel.tsx` per-operation Strategy + registry-factory split** — 🚧 vertical slice done,
  ~23 operations remain. `OperationPanel` fanned every one of its ~25 operations through five parallel
  `switch`/`if` ladders (render fields, build params, validate, two init effects) keyed on the same
  `operation` — a GoF **Strategy** pattern crying out to happen (Command was considered and rejected:
  the app already has a command/memento layer at the `Feature`/parametric-history level, so the panel
  only needs to *produce* params, not execute/undo them). Built `src/frontend/ui/operations/strategies/`:
  a `PanelState`-registry-factory-selectable structure at only migrated `FeatureOperation.BOX` and
  `FILLET` (one primitive, one selection-based op — bookend cases) to self-contained
  `forwardRef`+`useImperativeHandle` components (`OperationPanelProps`/`OperationPanelHandle` in
  `strategies/types.ts`), each owning its own local state, validity, and `buildParams`. `registry.ts`
  is a typed `Partial<Record<Operation, OperationPanelComponent>>` — `OperationPanel.tsx` checks it
  first and falls back to the legacy switch-based rendering for anything not yet migrated, so this
  landed with zero risk to the other ~23 operations. Shared logic factored out: `useEdgeSelection`
  (viewport-click-append hook — add `useFaceSelection` the same way when Shell/Offset migrate),
  `SelectorRuleInput` (the select-by-rule text/preset/live-checkbox block used by fillet/chamfer/shell).
  Verified in-browser: registry-routed Box primitive applies with reducer defaults; registry-routed
  Fillet correctly disables Apply with zero edges, resolves a selector-rule preset, and both succeeds
  (valid radius → real new faces in Entities panel) and fails-cleanly (radius too large for the edges →
  OCC rejects, feature stays in history failing every rebuild — same behavior the old switch-based path
  had, not a regression). Full 589-test suite green. **Next**: migrate the remaining primitives
  (Sphere/Cylinder/Cone/Torus/Wedge — same shape as Box), then Chamfer/Shell (same shape as Fillet plus
  `useFaceSelection` for Shell), then extrude/revolve/sweep/loft/boolean/transform — each migration is
  additive (new file + one registry line), no shell changes needed.
- **`prefer-useReducer` in `OperationPanel.tsx`** — ✅ done. The ~30 individual `useState` fields
  were collapsed into a single `useReducer` (`PanelState` + `panelReducer`), with a `set(patch)` helper
  and one `addToList` action for the sub-shape selection merges. Verified in-browser (Box primitive:
  reducer defaults render, edited field patches, Apply builds real geometry — 23 faces/72 edges, no
  degenerate result) and against the full 589-test suite. The remaining `useEffect`-from-props init
  pattern was preserved (dispatching one patch instead of many setters) rather than rewritten to lazy
  initializers, since the panel's prop-driven re-init on operation change still needs effects.
- **`no-derived-state`/`no-event-handler`/`no-adjust-state-on-prop-change`/`no-cascading-set-state`/
  `no-chain-state-updates`/`no-effect-chain`** — a handful remain in
  `SketchOverlay.tsx` — same systemic root cause: local state initialized from
  props via `useEffect`. `SketchOverlay.tsx`'s state is a poor reducer fit (independent
  transient-drawing vs. persisted grid prefs, updated at different times), so it was left as-is. Touches
  `SketchOverlay.tsx`'s
  tool-switching reset effect (line ~348), which is deliberately *not* touched here: past incidents
  (see `[[r3f-stable-event-handlers]]` memory) show refactoring this exact pointer/event-handler wiring
  can silently break sketch interactions.

Verified via `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose` (132 → 78 findings) plus a manual browser pass
(`bun run dev` + Playwright): selected Front Plane, entered sketch mode, drew a rectangle (auto-added 4
constraints), finished the sketch — confirming the `SketchOverlay.tsx` dependency-array changes didn't
break tool-switching or pointer handling. Full test suite (589 tests) and build pass throughout.
